🫀 Heart Disease Prediction App
This Streamlit-based web application predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input using a trained machine learning model.

🔍 Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction can significantly reduce the risk through timely diagnosis and lifestyle changes. This app helps users and health professionals to predict heart disease probability using clinical parameters like blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.

🚀 Features
✅ Interactive User Interface built with Streamlit

✅ Accepts patient health information through sliders & dropdowns

✅ Predicts whether the person has heart disease or not

✅ Displays prediction probability

✅ Real-time, responsive, and visually intuitive
